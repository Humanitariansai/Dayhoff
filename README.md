# Dayhoff Framework

An open-source, agent-based AI bioinformatics framework for computational biology, epidemiology, and public health. Named after pioneering scientist Margaret Belle Dayhoff, this framework orchestrates specialized AI agents to deliver cohesive, data-driven solutions for biological and health sciences.

## Overview

The Dayhoff framework (inspired by Margaret Belle Dayhoff, the pioneer in bioinformatics) is an open-source platform for AI-powered biological and public health intelligence. This experimental project creates an ecosystem of specialized agents orchestrated by a central coordination layer to tackle complex challenges in biology, epidemiology, and public health.

Led by Professor Nik Bear Brown, PhD, MBA, this educational experiment emphasizes learning through building, inviting contributors to discover effective approaches through practical implementation rather than claiming definitive solutions.

## Agent-Based Architecture

The Dayhoff framework organizes specialized agents into categories, each focused on different aspects of biological and health sciences:

### 1. Genomic Analysis Agents
Process and interpret genetic sequences, identify patterns, and predict structural and functional properties of biomolecules.

### 2. Epidemiological Agents
Track disease spread, analyze transmission patterns, and model potential interventions for public health crises.

### 3. Clinical Intelligence Agents
Analyze medical literature, patient data, and treatment outcomes to identify effective health interventions.

### 4. Molecular Modeling Agents
Simulate protein folding, drug interactions, and molecular dynamics to accelerate discovery processes.

### 5. Biostatistical Agents
Apply advanced statistical methods to biological data, ensuring rigorous analysis and meaningful conclusions.

### 6. Public Health Monitoring Agents
Track population health metrics, environmental factors, and social determinants of health across communities.

## The Dayhoff Orchestration Layer

At the heart of the framework is the Dayhoff orchestration layer, which coordinates the activities of specialized agents to systematically address biological and public health challenges:

- **Cross-Agent Validation**: Testing approaches to identifying when different agents reach contradictory conclusions and resolving analytical conflicts.

- **Dynamic Task Allocation**: Exploring methodologies for distributing computational resources based on changing health priorities.

- **Pattern Recognition**: Experimenting with identifying connections across seemingly unrelated biological and epidemiological data.

- **Decision Optimization**: Translating insights into actionable public health interventions and research directions.

- **Continuous Learning**: Implementing approaches that allow the entire framework to improve over time through accumulated knowledge.

## Current Key Projects

### PredictaBio
Transforming protein synthesis with artificial intelligence by creating "recipes" for novel proteins with specific properties. This project accelerates the discovery process and enables the design of proteins tailored to diverse applications in biotechnology, healthcare, and sustainability.

**Implementation Process**:
1. Use generative AI to design novel protein sequences with specific properties
2. Optimize protein folding and function through computational modeling
3. Streamline the production process to improve efficiency and reduce costs
4. Apply responsible AI development to address global challenges

### The RAMAN Effect Project
Revolutionizing public health through AI-enhanced Wastewater-Based Epidemiology (WBE) using Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS). This project develops sophisticated AI software capable of analyzing large volumes of spectral data to detect pathogens and pollutants with unprecedented accuracy, enabling real-time, cost-effective public health monitoring on a global scale.

**Implementation Process**:
1. Integrate Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) with deep learning models
2. Develop AI algorithms for decoding complex Raman spectra
3. Analyze pooled wastewater for pathogens, pollutants, and emerging substances
4. Enable real-time, scalable, and cost-effective public health surveillance
