2025-12-18 — Bi-Weekly Update (12/05–12/18)

Role: AI Research Analyst — RAMAN Effect (SERS + AI for WBE)
Project Lead: Edward Alano
Period covered: 2025-12-05 → 2025-12-18
Hours this period: ~41
Notes: Focused on deepening technical understanding of SERS limitations and ML-driven mitigation strategies as outlined by project lead.

Summary of Work (past two weeks)

Reviewed and analyzed core challenges limiting SERS commercialization, including signal variability, substrate inconsistency, lack of calibration standards, and poor cross-lab reproducibility.

Studied provided and external literature addressing reproducibility, validation, and benchmarking of SERS against established analytical techniques.

Began mapping how machine learning methods (feature learning, normalization, pattern recognition) can directly address known SERS limitations such as signal variability and uncorrelated measurements.

Started outlining a dedicated subsection discussing why ML is critical for making SERS practical and scalable, framing this as the core motivation of the Raman Effect project.

Consolidated notes from chemistry-oriented and ML-oriented perspectives to ensure consistency when merging sections later.

Challenges & How Addressed

Limited access to biological SERS datasets: Since new experimental data is not currently available, focused efforts on literature-backed analysis, prior experimental results, and defining ML-ready problem formulations.

Reproducibility concerns in existing SERS studies: Addressed by reviewing validation strategies and identifying ML techniques that explicitly improve robustness and generalization.

Goals (next two weeks)

Draft a structured subsection on ML-driven solutions to SERS reproducibility and validation challenges.

Continue refining Sections 4 and 5 with emphasis on AI’s role in mitigating experimental variability.
