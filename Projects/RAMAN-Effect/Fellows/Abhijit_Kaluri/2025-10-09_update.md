Summary of Work (past two weeks)

Reviewed existing citation list in sections 3 and began redoing references due to inconsistencies and missing documentation.

Reorganized literature notes to ensure proper source traceability.

Coordinated with project lead regarding formatting standards for references and figure captions.

Finalize the complete reference list with verified metadata.

Integrate updated citations into the Introduction and Methods sections.

Polish infographics and captions for internal review.
