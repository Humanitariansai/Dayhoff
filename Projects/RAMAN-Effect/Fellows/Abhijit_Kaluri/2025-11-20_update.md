2025-11-20 — Bi-Weekly Update (11/07–11/20)

Role: AI Research Analyst — RAMAN Effect (SERS + AI for WBE)
Project Lead: Edward Alano
Period covered: 2025-11-07 → 2025-11-20
Hours this period: ~40
Notes: Focused heavily on merging earlier sections, correcting citations, and started drafting Sections 4

**Summary of Work (past two weeks)**

Continued drafting of Sections 4 and 5, including structure, key arguments, and preliminary text.
Began integrating and cleaning citations across all previous sections — because the early document was developed independently by both contributors, citation styles and sources needed chronological alignment and verification.
Merged overlapping content from earlier drafts to maintain consistent narrative flow.
Started compiling chemistry-specific reference points in anticipation of lead author inputs/comments on word

**Challenges & How Addressed**
Citation inconsistencies: Earlier references lacked proper metadata or source alignment; resolved by re-verifying citations manually and reorganizing them chronologically.
Section continuity: Differences in writing styles and pacing were reduced through reorganizing paragraphs and merging duplicated concepts.

**Goals (next two weeks)**
Move Sections 4 toward full first drafts.
Finalize merged citations across all completed sections.
Incorporate chemistry-focused content once provided by project lead.
Begin standardizing figures/infographics to match the updated structure.
