Role: AI Research Analyst — RAMAN Effect (SERS + AI for WBE)
Project Lead: Edward Alano
Period covered: 2025-11-21 → 2025-12-04
Hours this period: ~41
Notes: Continued manuscript consolidation and refinement while integrating corrections across earlier sections.

Summary of Work (past two weeks)

Continued chronological reconstruction of citations for Sections 2–5, ensuring consistency between independently written drafts.

Refined and reorganized a portion of Section 4 (AI/ML methodology) and Section 5 (SERS–WBE pipeline interpretation) based on updated references.

Began merging figure notes and preliminary infographic descriptions into the working draft for eventual Overleaf integration.

Added internal comments for alignment between chemistry-focused and ML-focused subsections so they can be stitched cleanly in the next revision.

Challenges & How Addressed

Citation reconciliation still ongoing: Earlier text lacked traceable references; continued verifying original sources and replacing placeholders with verifiable citations.


Goals (next two weeks: by 2025-12-18)

Complete verified citation pass for remaining subsections in Sections 4 and 5.

Start assembling figure layouts once supporting data references are finalized.
